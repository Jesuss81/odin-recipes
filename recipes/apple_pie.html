        <ol id="dlist">
            <li><h3><p>Make the pie crust: Whisk flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add butter </p>
                <p>and toss until pieces are completely separated and coated with flour mixture. </p>
                <p>Using your hands, work butter into the flour mixture until well combined and </p>
                <p>butter pieces are no larger than a pea.</p></h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>Gently stir in 1/4 cup cold water with a spatula until completely absorbed. Add </p>
                    <p>remaining 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, gently stirring between each </p>
                    <p>addition, until dough begins to form into a ball. Depending on how humid it is </p>
                    <p>in your kitchen or how hydrated your flour is, you might not need to use all of </p>
                    <p>the water.</p></h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>Transfer dough to a clean work surface and gently knead, being careful not to</p>
                    <p>overwork it, until smooth and slightly tacky. Divide dough evenly into 2 pieces. </p>
                    <p>Form each piece into a flat disk and wrap individually in plastic wrap. Chill </p>
                    <p>dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 3 days. (If chilling for </p>
                    <p>longer than 1 hour, let dough sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes </p>
                    before rolling in Step 9.)</h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>While the dough is chilling, make the caramel sauce: Heat sugar in a small </p>
                    <p>saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until completely melted and </p>
                    <p>amber in color, 10 to 15 minutes. Add butter to melted sugar and cook, stirring </p>
                    constantly, until butter is melted and completely combined, about 1 minute.</h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>Carefully add heavy cream to sugar mixture, stirring constantly, until bubbly, </p>
                    <p>15 to 30 seconds. Remove saucepan from the heat and stir in sea salt. Set </p>
                    caramel sauce aside to cool slightly at room temperature until ready to use.</h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>Make the filling: Stir apples, sugar, flour, lemon juice, cornstarch, cinnamon, </p>
                    <p>salt, cloves, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until well combined. Set apple </p>
                    mixture aside at room temperature, uncovered, for 30 minutes.</h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>Pour apple mixture through a strainer into a large bowl. Set apple mixture</p>
                    <p>aside, and transfer the strained liquid to a small saucepan. Bring liquid to a boil </p>
                    <p>over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Remove saucepan from </p>
                    the heat and set aside at room temperature.</h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Position an oven rack in </p>
                    bottom third of oven.</h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>Working with one dough disk at a time on a surface lightly dusted with flour, </p>
                    <p>roll each disk into a 1/8-inch thick circle that measures 12 inches in diameter. </p>
                    <p>Place one dough circle in a 9-inch pie pan and gently press dough into the </p>
                    corners and sides of the pan.</h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>Stir together apples and reduced apple liquid in large bowl; arrange apple </p>
                    <p>mixture in the pie crust, and drizzle with 1/2 cup of the caramel sauce. Place </p>
                    <p>remaining dough circle over top and press into apple mixture and into edges </p>
                    <p>of pan. Using your fingers, fold the edges under and crimp to seal. Brush the </p>
                    <p>top and edges of dough with beaten egg and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. </p>
                    <p>Cut eight 1-inch slits in the dough with a sharp paring knife to allow steam </p>
                    to escape. Place pie on a rimmed sheet pan.</h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>Bake pie in the preheated oven until the top is light golden in color, about </p>
                    <p>20 minutes. Without removing the pie, reduce the oven temperature to </p>
                    <p>375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and continue baking until dough is deep </p>
                    <p>golden brown and filling is starting to bubble, about 25 minutes. Gently </p>
                    <p>cover pie with aluminum foil, and continue baking until a knife inserted </p>
                    in the center comes out mostly clean, about 25 minutes.</h3></li>
                <li><h3><p>Remove pie from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, </p>
                    about 2 hours. Serve pie with remaining caramel sauce, if desired.</h3></li>
