A breif intro to the project

first of all I made a main page to direct the other pages through it.
then I start for making a page showing how to make toscana.
in this page there is a description of toscana and then a picture of it
wich is in the final step.
then there is requirments for the food. I made in an unorderd list, so the 
page be in order.for this list I put the contents in strong and em flags so
the text will be bold and fancy.
after it I made a new list, but this time an orderd list to show the steps 
for making this meal.the texts in this list are putet in h3 flag so they are a bit bigger than usual.

I do the above things for the steak and apple_pie page too.
